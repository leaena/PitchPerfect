#### Pitch Perfect

Going through the [Udacity iOS nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/nd003) for funsies! Pitch Perfect is the app you build in [Intro to iOS App Development with Swift](https://www.udacity.com/course/ud585).

Just going to throw some links here to look into later: [Stack Overflow Obj C record/play sound](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5662297/how-to-record-and-play-sound-in-iphone-app) and [Apple Documentation on AVAudioPlayer .volume](https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/ios/documentation/AVFoundation/Reference/AVAudioPlayerClassReference/index.html#//apple_ref/occ/instp/AVAudioPlayer/volume). suspicious of the .volume one though as it says it defaults to loudest (1.0). :(
